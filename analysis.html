      <strong>Country Wise Arrivals</strong>
      <br>
      It is evident that there has been a general increase in the number of travelers over the years. Many countries have experienced growth in their travel numbers, indicating an overall expansion in global tourism. However, the year 2020 stands out as an exception due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant decline in travel worldwide.
<br>
<br>
      Among the countries listed, the United States has consistently shown the highest number of travelers, followed by China, Japan, and the United Kingdom. These countries have large populations and strong economies, which contribute to their higher travel numbers. The United States experienced steady growth in travel until 2020, while China and Japan saw fluctuations over the years.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some countries experienced notable growth in travel during this period. For instance, India had a significant increase in travel numbers, with Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka also showing consistent growth. These countries may have benefited from increased tourism promotion, improved infrastructure, or other factors attracting travelers.
      <br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, some countries experienced fluctuating travel numbers or even declines. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Greece showed varying patterns, which could be influenced by factors such as economic instability, political situations, or changing travel preferences.

<strong>Foreign Exchange Earning </strong>
<br>
the data shows a general increasing trend in foreign exchange earnings from 2014 to 2019, with fluctuations occurring within each year. However, the year 2020 stands out as an exception due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant negative impact on foreign exchange earnings.
<br>
<br>
In the earlier years, from 2014 to 2016, there was a gradual increase in foreign exchange earnings. This could be attributed to factors such as economic growth, increased tourism, or favorable exchange rates. The months of January, February, and March consistently recorded higher earnings during this period.
<br>
<br>
From 2017 to 2019, there was a notable surge in foreign exchange earnings. The earnings reached their peak in 2019, indicating a positive growth trajectory. This period may have been influenced by factors such as increased international trade, foreign investment, or a booming tourism industry. The months of November and December consistently recorded higher earnings during these years.
<br>
However, in 2020, there was a sharp decline in foreign exchange earnings, particularly during the months of April and May. This can be attributed to the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to travel restrictions, lockdowns, and a significant reduction in economic activity. The gradual recovery in earnings observed towards the end of 2020 may indicate some resilience and adaptation within the economy.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Female Ratio</strong>
<br>
In recent years, there has been a notable rise in the number of female travelers visiting India, indicating a positive shift in perceptions and comfort levels among women tourists. Although the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary decline in overall tourism, the trend of more female travelers choosing India as their destination remains strong. This can be attributed to the efforts made by the Indian government and tourism bodies to enhance safety and security for all visitors, with a specific focus on female travelers. Measures such as the establishment of tourist police units, women-only taxi services, and dedicated helpline numbers have contributed to creating a safer environment. Additionally, India's increasing emphasis on gender equality and women's empowerment has transformed societal attitudes, making public spaces more inclusive and welcoming. The country's rich culture, diverse landscapes, and the rise of social media have also played a role in attracting female travelers. Accommodations and services tailored to women's needs have emerged, including women-friendly accommodations, women-only tours, and travel groups. While progress has been made, continuous efforts are necessary to ensure the ongoing safety and comfort of all visitors, and collaborations between the government, tourism industry, and local communities can further enhance the travel experience for women in India.
